In this project, we are analyzing the sales of a coffee shop over time based on customer and product attributes.

### Tools
- Excel: Used VLOOKUP, INDEX, and MATCH functions to get data corresponding to customer and product related details.

### Data Cleaning
- Checked for duplicates, missing values and discrepancies in the data and improved the data reliability by removing duplicates, handling null values and correcting the discrepancies.

### Insights Drawn
- Majority of the sales i.e. 79% are from USA.
- The most sold coffee type is excelsa and liberica.  
- The coffee sales were highest in 2021 and lowest in 2022 due to incomplete data.
- Most of the customers prefer light-roasted coffee beans.
- Monetary contribution of people without loyalty cards is higher compared to customers with loyalty cards.


### Strategy Recommendations
- Region specific marketing could be useful to increase sales in various countries.
- Customers can be introduced to a loyalty program where they earn coffee points on each purchase and these points can be exchanged for a coffee type later.  
- Subscription packages could be provided for customers to receive regular deliveries of coffee beans.
- The business could partner with other local businesses to increase sales.
- Targeted campaigns for high selling coffee beans could be used to emphasise their unique flavours.
- Given the popularity of certain coffee types and roast preferences, the product line could be expanded to include new variations.
